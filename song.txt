If I stay with you, if I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all
If I'm losing now, but I'm winning late
That's all I want
Now we need some space 'cause I feel for you
And I wanna change
Growing up alone, it seems so short
I can't explain
Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else, even when you feel
I don't care at all, I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on
